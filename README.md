# footer-design

**Please link iconset in the head of the footer-custom.html file**

Assignment
Create a footer design for the new Magento 2 template for our main shop:
• Include the elements and information from the current template in the design (customer service, tagline, page links, social media, blog posts, videos, etc.).
• Use one of the demo pages of the purchased template as a basis.
• Apply the corporate identity (colorscheme and fonts) as used in the current template.
• The design doesn’t have to be an exact copy of the footer design of our current shop, as long
as all the elements are present. Feel free to adjust the design according to your vision and experience.
